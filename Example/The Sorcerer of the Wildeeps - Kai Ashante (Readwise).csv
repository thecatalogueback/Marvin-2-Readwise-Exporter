"For LeRoy Whitfield, who fell first,though ten times the warrior I was then or ever will be",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"While it was true that most brothers showed purer descent from that half of the mulatto north supposedly more blessed with brawn than brains, and for the merchants it was the other way around—brighter of complexion (and intellect?)—did it necessarily follow that one group deserved fine speech, while the other should get nasty words sprinkled on every single sentence",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"After that last clash with bandits, Demane had tended the injuries of all the brothers save for Faedou, who, it seemed, feared the pollution of heathen arts even more than death by gangrene.[Saprogenic possession], [antibiotic exorcism], the perils of [sepsis and necrotizing tissues] . . . Demane had perhaps doomed Faedou, in speaking such terms without knowing them in a common language. To superstitious ears, nothing distinguished those untranslated words from the veriest babble of demon worship.",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"Prayer and trust in Him. His justice and mercy: that’s all I need. Maybe I’ll wade in the Blood of the River soon. That’s all right. I asked the Dove to come down to my shoulder long ago. Won’t you ask Him too, brother? For it’s said in the Recital of Life and Days—”",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"See the Daughter?” Faedou pointed to the river that wound southwest, outflowing from Mother of Waters. “A few leagues south of here, Daughter runs into another river called the Crossings that goes straight west. Other side of the Crossings, it’s the Wildeeps. You’ll see what I mean soon enough.",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,I really like how the explanation of location is done here. Weaving folklore and mythology into the actual physical locality of things.,
"Perhaps in some sense it was “witchcraft” when Demane waved his hand through a cloud of mosquitoes, and then nobody else was bitten the rest of the night. But was it “witchcraft” when some unlucky brother stubbed his toe? Or bit down on sandy grit in his porridge? Everything can’t be witchcraft!",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"It’s them magi live down by Olorum who made the Road. Put some kind of hoodoo on it: to keep off beasts and thing. But you oughta know more about all this demon-raising business than me. Right, Sorcerer?”",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
Men on this side of the continent thought they were the best at everything,The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"Talk of whores diverted elsewhere, now in hushed tones, brothers leaning together like boys trading nasty whispers within earshot of the father.",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"Scarcely could he steal a moment to gasp for breath between attacks. At this pace, defense was the best he could do, offense out of the question.",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
Absurd control! Captain could have won the bout at any moment from the first.,The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"Two things occurred: one thought, one action.Demane pulled the strike, of course—hauling back and jerking it aside with violence sufficient to knock himself over. Even so, the blade pierced the captain’s robe and some flesh too. And Demane’s thought?He did that on purpose.",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"The plunging spear halted a hair’s breadth above Demane’s navel—content, today, to mime the blow and deal none. Captain wins!",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
"To Demane, the captain’s front was flimsy and collapsed with the slightest scrutiny. But the brothers stayed convinced, believing Captain to be precisely what he seemed.",The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps,Kai Ashante Wilson,,,
